# What is GearBot?
A Discord moderation bot, one of the better ones, and still improving, gear by gear.

# How to add and use GearBot
See the [Adding Gearbot](guides/adding_gearbot) for more details. You can click the next button at the top each time to go to the next guide that will help you setup parts of GearBot.

# How to contribute to GearBot
GearBot is fully open source and can be found [here](https://github.com/AEnterprise/GearBot). And pull requests are more then welcome, please stop by on the [support server](https://discord.gg/S4DBxtC) first, open an issue about what you want to make or reply to an existing one if one already exists. This way I know a PR will be coming and can avoid both of us working on the same thing at the same time. 

# Where can i get support, make requests or ask other questions?
